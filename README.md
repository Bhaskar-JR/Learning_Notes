#### The procedure of “general to specific modeling”
Steps | Details
---- | ---  
Step 1 | Estimate the parameters of the general model   
Step 2 | Check whether each explanatory variable in the general model is statistically significant \n(e.g., by means of t-Statistics)
Step 3 | If all the explanatory variables are statistically significant, leave the model in its current form (that is, with all the initial variables). 
Step 4 | Remove from the model the variable which is the least statistically significant (e.g., has the lowest absolute value of t-Statistic)
Step 5 | Reestimate the model without the removed explanatory variable
Step 6 | Return back to Steps 2–5 
Step 7 | Continue the procedure until You end up with the model in which all the final explanatory variables are statistically significant
